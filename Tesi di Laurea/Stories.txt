 Once upon a time, in a city far far away, there was a black cat.
His name was John, and he was very sad, because he was so lonely. 
One day, he met a big white dog standing in front of  the police department... 
he was hungry and looked scared and, most of all, lonely like him! 
so he decided to make friendship with him.
